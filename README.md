There are best cheat-sheets I could either create by myself or (most of them) are taken from somewhere.

## [bash and zsh](src/bash-zsh.md)
## [unix screen](src/screen.md) and [tmux](src/tmux.md)
## [git](src/git.md), [git-flow](src/git-flow.md) and [git-extras](src/git-extras.md)
## [idea](src/idea.md)
## [curl](src/curl.md) and [wget](src/wget.md)
## [strace](src/strace.md)
## [google chrome](src/google-chrome.md)

#### Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this repo, consider a good cheat should be a one-pager and contain most common information about a peace of software.
For a deeper dive into this software, provide links to a more comprehansive information.

If you see a lack of something in the cheat sheet, feel free to make your contibution.
