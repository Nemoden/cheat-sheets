There are best cheat-sheets I could either create by myself or (most of them) are taken from somewhere.

## [bash and zsh](bash-zsh.md)
## [unix screen](screen.md) and [tmux](tmux.md)
## [git](git.md), [git-flow](git-flow.md) and [git-extras](git-extras.md)
## [idea](idea.md)
## [curl](curl.md) and [wget](wget.md)
## [google chrome](google-chrome.md)
